Predicting Disease Spread
Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease that occurs in tropical and sub-tropical parts of the world. In mild cases, symptoms are similar to the flu: fever, rash, and muscle and joint pain. In severe cases, dengue fever can cause severe bleeding, low blood pressure, and even death.

Because it is carried by mosquitoes, the transmission dynamics of dengue are related to climate variables such as temperature and precipitation. Although the relationship to climate is complex, a growing number of scientists argue that climate change is likely to produce distributional shifts that will have significant public health implications worldwide.

In recent years dengue fever has been spreading. Historically, the disease has been most prevalent in Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands. These days many of the nearly half billion cases per year are occurring in Latin America.

Using environmental data collected by various U.S. Federal Government agencies—from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the U.S. Department of Commerce—can you predict the number of dengue fever cases reported each week in San Juan, Puerto Rico and Iquitos, Peru?

An understanding of the relationship between climate and dengue dynamics can improve research initiatives and resource allocation to help fight life-threatening pandemics.

## Dataset

The data for this competition comes from multiple sources aimed at supporting the Predict the Next Pandemic Initiative. Dengue surveillance data is provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and prevention, as well as the Department of Defense's Naval Medical Research Unit 6 and the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center, in collaboration with the Peruvian government and U.S. universities. Environmental and climate data is provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce.

In their own words:

Accurate dengue predictions would help public health workers ... and people around the world take steps to reduce the impact of these epidemics. But predicting dengue is a hefty task that calls for the consolidation of different data sets on disease incidence, weather, and the environment.

This is a complicated and messy problem, to be sure. But real data is often complicated and messy. Study up using the resources below—your insights could save lives!

## Goal 

Your goal is to predict the total_cases label for each (city, year, weekofyear) in the test set. There are two cities, San Juan and Iquitos, with test data for each city spanning 5 and 3 years respectively. You will make one submission that contains predictions for both cities. The data for each city have been concatenated along with a city column indicating the source: sj for San Juan and iq for Iquitos. The test set is a pure future hold-out, meaning the test data are sequential and non-overlapping with any of the training data. Throughout, missing values have been filled as NaNs.
